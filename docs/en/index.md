## Goal

Build a production-grade foundation for the **3 core courses in the Machine Learning line** of the MS in AI Pathway:

- Supervised Learning (Module 05)
- Unsupervised Learning (Module 06)
- Deep Learning (Module 07)

This English version is **adapted and concise**. Some detailed modules are still in Spanish; links will take you to the Spanish originals until the translation is completed.

## Practical notes (v3.3)

- From-scratch implementations: no scikit-learn for the core algorithms.
- CNNs:
  - forward pass in NumPy (shapes-first understanding)
  - full CNN training with PyTorch (script deliverable)
